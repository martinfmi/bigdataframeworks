# bigdataframeworks
Examples of several popular frameworks for big data processing that can be used in Java applications. 
Each of the frameworks is demonstrated by implementing a simple pipeline for processing of data from devices that measure the air quality index for a given area.
For simplicity we will assume that numeric data from the devices is either received in batches or in a streaming fashion. 
The following frameworks are demonstrated:

* Apache Spark
* Apache Flink
* Apache Storm
* Apache Ignite
* Hazelcast JET
* Kafka Streams
* Pulsar Functions
