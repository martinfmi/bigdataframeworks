# Examples on various frameworks for big data processing
Examples of several popular frameworks for big data processing that can be used in Java applications. 
Each of the frameworks is demonstrated by implementing a simple pipeline for processing of data from devices that measure the air quality index for a given area.
For simplicity we will assume that numeric data from the devices is either received in batches or in a streaming fashion. 
The following frameworks are demonstrated:

* Apache Spark
* Apache Flink
* Apache Storm
* Apache Ignite
* Hazelcast Jet
* Kafka Streams
* Pulsar Functions
